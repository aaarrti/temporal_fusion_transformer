- The implementation as well as experimental setting closely follow the ones described by Bryan Lim, Sercan O. Arik,
  Nicolas Loeff, Tomas Pfister
  in their
  publication [Temporal Fusion Transformers for Interpretable Multi-horizon Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.09363)
- The codebase is mostly adapted
  from [google-research/google-research/tft](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/tft)
